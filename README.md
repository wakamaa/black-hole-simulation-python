# Black Hole Geodesic Simulation

A numerical simulation of light rays bending around a non-rotating black hole (a Schwarzschild black hole). This project was developed as a fun python project, using `matplotlib` for real-time visualization and is inspired by other projects prior.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Visualization:** Uses `matplotlib` to render the paths of photons as they travel through spacetime.
- **Geodesic Integration:** Employs the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method to accurately solve the geodesic equations of motion.
- **Physics-based:** The simulation is grounded in the principles of General Relativity, modeling the effects of a massive body on light.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You will also need the following libraries:

matplotlib==3.8.3
numpy==1.26.4

Running the Simulation

    Clone this repository to your local machine:
    Bash

git clone [https://github.com/wakamaa/black-hole-simulation.git](https://github.com/wakamaa/black-hole-simulation.git)

Navigate to the project directory:
Bash

cd black-hole-simulation

Run the simulation:
Bash

    python black-hole-simulation.py

### Code Structure
